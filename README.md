This is a small React application that I created to learn the fundamentals of React. While building this app, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Conditional Rendering**: I implemented conditional rendering to display different content based on specific conditions, such as marking items as "SOLD OUT."

- **Rendering a List**: I learned how to map through an array of data and dynamically render a list of items. In this case, I created a pizza menu.

- **JSX Syntax**: I improved my understanding of JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript often used in React applications.
